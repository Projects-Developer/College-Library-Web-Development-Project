## Abstract: 
This project aims to design and develop a web-based library management system for a college library. The system will provide a user-friendly interface for users to search, browse, and access library resources online. It will also enable library administrators to manage library collections, track borrowing and returning of books, and generate reports. The system will be developed using a combination of front-end and back-end technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a relational database management system. The proposed system will improve accessibility to library resources, enhance user experience, and increase efficiency in library management.
